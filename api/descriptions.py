'Bhimsen_Temple':'''Bhimsen (Bhimasena) Temple of Lalitpur (1682) (Nepali:  भिमसेन मन्दिर)
The Bhimsen (or Bhimasena) temple is the northernmost of the major monuments in the Mangal Palace square, located directly adjacent to the Vishveshvar (Vishwanath) temple and diagonally opposite the Mani Mandapa pavilions and fountain to the southeast. Dedicated to Bhimsen, the god of trade among the Newars, the monument is of uncertain age but was rebuilt in 1682 by Shrinivas Malla (r. 1661-85) following a fire. Later reconstructions took place in 1934, following the great earthquake, and again in 1967. Although the temple was significantly damaged (though not leveled) in the April 2015 earthquake, it reopened in early 2022 after a thoroughgoing reconstruction that retained much material from its pre-earthquake form.

Like all Bhimsen temples, its ground floor plan is rectangular, with Bhimsen himself residing on the first floor (i.e., one floor above ground level). According to Michael Hutt, the temple is managed by the Kapali-Jogi, a Newar caste of Shaiva renouncers who perform services such as death rituals and religious music for community members. The shrine to Bhimsen, which they maintain, is strictly off-limits to foreigners, who are barred from entering the sanctum via its steep staircase (see image 62), but visitors are otherwise welcome to approach the building's exterior from all angles.

Bhimsen is traditionally understood as one of five brothers (collectively, the Pandavas) who were fathered by Pandu, as described in the Mahabharata, the ancient Sanskrit epic. However, as Ronald Bernier notes, in Nepal, "...here, he has been elevated to the status of a major god and his image is central to the temple's main shrine" (Bernier, p. 69). The deity is fashioned with a long skirt, legs astride, cloaked in mail, and grasping a large club. He is helmeted with headgear described as "Grecian." As noted by Bal Gopal Shreshtha, Newar traders traditionally believe that anyone who can please Bhimsen is compensated with profitable business arrangements, and images of Bhimsen are typically carried to wherever the Newar business community operates. The association of Bhimsen with commerce is, as described by Mary Slusser, an "unexplained metamorphosis" (Slusser, p. 258) from his traditional role as a hero in the Indian tradition, where commerce is generally the realm of Ganesha. She notes that Bhimsen may also be worshiped as a god of love, perhaps due to his affection for Draupadi, the Pandava brothers' shared wife.

Several features of the Bhimsen temple are unusual. First, it is the only monument in the Mangal palace (Darbar) square decorated with long pataka strips, which traditionally are thought to represent a divine ladder allowing deities to descend to-and-fro from their celestial abode. Second, the east-facing balcony is entirely covered in shiny gilding, including the various wooden brackets that depict Shiva, Parvati, Bhairava, and Ganesh. Finally, each roof tier is given its own metal finials; while not unusual, it is not a standard feature. As noted by Michael Hutt, one other unusual aspect is that the dedicatory inscription from Srinivas Malla's period records all three of the valley's kingdoms (Patan/Lalitpur, Kathmandu, and Bhaktapur) were at peace—a rare enough occurrence that it was worth memorializing.

 'Char_Narayan_Temple':'''Char Narayan Dega Temple (built 1566) (Nepali: चार नारायण मन्दिर)
Char Narayan, also called the Jagat Narayan, is perhaps the oldest temple in Patan's Darbar Square. Unlike other temples in the square, it is constructed primarily of brick. It was built in 1566 to memorialize the father of Purandar Singh, a nobleman who controlled the Kathmandu area in the late 16th century. It honors Narayan, another name for Vishnu.

In plan, the temple is laid out as a near-perfect square measuring 6.62 x 6.63 meters with a height of 10.6 meters (in addition to the height of the 2.49 meter plinth). Its outer walls are faced with three doors on each side, leading to an ambulatory that surrounds a central cella. A single door on each face of the cella provides access to the centrally-placed image. Wolfgang Korn suggests the central image is a linga, whereas Michael Hutt indicates that it houses an image of Vishna's four manefestations. Specifically, on the east, Sankarshana holds a pestle and plow; on the south, Vasudeva wields a club and wheel; to the west, Pradyumna holds a bow and arrow; and to the north, Aniruddha wields a sword and shield. 

The temple was completely leveled as a result of the April 2015 earthquake. However, due to quick thinking by the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust (or KVPT, which has an office in the same area), security was brought in to oversee the removal and safeguarding of the site's architectural fragments. It underwent restoration by the KVPT, the World Monuments Fund, and additional support from the United States Embassy, through the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP). The temple was completely restored as of January 2020.

 'Dhungey_Dhara':'''A dhunge dhara (Nepali: ढुङ्गे धारा ) or hiti (Newari) is a traditional stone drinking fountain found in Nepal. It is an intricately carved stone waterway through which water flows uninterrupted from underground sources. Dhunge dharas are part of a comprehensive drinking water supply system, commissioned by various rulers of Ancient and Medieval Nepal. The system is supported by numerous ponds and canals that form an elaborate network of water bodies, created as a water resource during the dry season and to help alleviate the water pressure caused by the monsoon rains. After the introduction of modern, piped water systems, starting in the late 19th century, this old system has fallen into disrepair and some parts of it are lost forever. Nevertheless, many people of Nepal still rely on the old dhunge dharas on a daily basis.

History
The history of dhunge dharas began during the Licchavi Kingdom (c. 400–750 AD). The earliest record of a dhunge dhara names king Brisasdev (c. 400–425 AD) as the creator of the water system
Manga Hiti at Mangal Bazar in Patan is considered to be the oldest working dhunge dhara on record. It was built in 570 AD. In the case of the Hadi Gaun hiti and Manga Hiti, the dates were engraved on a stone within the hiti. Gradually more hitis started to appear elsewhere in Kathmandu Valley.

'Garuda_Pillar':'''Garuda in Hinduism-
Garuda, the divine bird and mount of Lord Vishnu, is a prominent figure in Hinduism. Depicted with a golden human-like body, red wings, and an eagle's beak, Garuda symbolizes strength and power. In Hindu mythology, he is the eternal adversary of the Nāga serpent race and is known for feeding exclusively on snakes. Garuda is revered for his role in protecting against snake attacks and poison.

Significance-

    Garuda is mentioned in ancient texts like the Vedas, with various names attributing to him.
    Worship of Garuda is believed to counteract the effects of poisons, and he is invoked in rituals against snake bites.
    In the Bhagavad-Gita, Lord Krishna identifies himself with Garuda, emphasizing his importance in Hindu cosmology.

Symbolic Representations-

    Garuda wears serpents as ornaments, symbolizing his dominance over snakes.
    In the Krishna Avatar, Garuda plays a crucial role in defeating Narakasura and saving the devotee elephant Gajendra.
    The positioning of Garuda's hands gives rise to the name 'Kai Yendhi Perumal' in Tamil.

Spiritual Significance-

    Garuda is associated with the five vayus (prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana) and represents knowledge, linking to higher consciousness.
    His wings, when in flight, are said to chant the Vedas, signifying divine knowledge.

Cultural Influence-

    Garuda holds cultural significance beyond Hinduism, with Indonesia adopting a stylized version as its national symbol.

In essence, Garuda is a powerful and revered deity embodying protection, strength, and spiritual significance in Hindu mythology.

 'Harishankara_temple':'''Harishankar Temple (built 1704-05 or 1706) (Nepali: हरिशंकर मन्दिर)
Harishankar is a three-story structure dedicated to Hari Shankar, a half Vishnu, half Shiva deity. Its roof structure is carved with scenes of the condemned being tortured in the various hells. It was constructed by Rudramati, the sister of of King Yoga Narendra Malla (r. 1685–1705).

The temple collapsed in the 2015 earthquake, leaving little more than the plinth standing. Reconstruction was completed in late 2019 through the combined efforts of the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust (KVPT), the Gemany and Japanese Embassies, the National Reconstruction Authority, and various other donors. As can be seen in the above images, the restoration teams were able to recover and reuse a variety of carved wooden elements that survived the quake which were then painstakingly cleaned and reassembled.

 'Krishna_Mandir':'''Krishna Mandir Temple (built 1631-37) (Nepali: कृष्ण मन्दिर)
The Krishna temple on the west side of Patan's Darbar square was completed in 1637. Legend says that it was inspired by a dream. One night, King Siddhi Narasingh Malla (r. 1620-61) dreamt that the gods Krishna and Radha were standing in front of the palace. The King ordered a temple built on the same location. During a war with a neighboring kingdom a decade later, the King emerged victorious after calling on Krishna to vanquish his enemies. In gratitude, the King built a replica of the temple inside the Sundari Chauk courtyard.

The Krishna temple is built in the sikhara style common to north India and Bengal, a design technique found in monuments as far afield as Bagan, Myanmar. Beneath its 21 golden pinnacles are three floors. The first floor enshrines Krishna, the second Shiva (in the form of a linga), and the third Lokeshwor. Except for the ground floor, a series of chhatri pavilions frame the inner ambulatories; eight each are located at the corners and cardinal directions of the second and third levels, while the fourth level includes four ornamental chattri built directly into each face of the sikhara. On the ground floor, the inner walls of the wraparound gallery are divided into five bays on each side, with a door located at the center of each facade. The remaining bays feature scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata narrated in Newari script.

Krishna is believed to be an earthly incarnation of Vishnu; hence, images of Vishnu and his mount, Garuda, are found throughout the temple. Four full-size statues of Vishnu upon Garuda surround the base of the sikhara, while bas-reliefs of the same theme are located on the ground floor cornices. Depictions of the 10 avatars of Vishnu are also set on the outside face of the ground-level gallery. A freestanding statue of gided Garuda, mounted upon a pole, is set in front of the temple. It was erected by Siddhi Narasingh Malla about ten years after construction of the temple.

The Krishna Mandir is managed by local Brahmins and is still used, though entrance is forbidden to non-Hindus (as was the case with the nearby Bhimsen temple, currently awaiting restoration as it was completely destroyed in the 2015 earthquake).

The temple was hard-hit by the 2015 earthquake, sustaining structural damage, particularly to its upper floors. It was painstakingly restored by the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust (KVPT) at the cost of 5.7 million Nepali rupees (~$55,000 USD) and reopened to pilgrims and tourists in 2018.

 'Narayan_Temple':'''Narayan Temple (1652) (Nepali: नारायण मन्दिर)
The Narayan is a small jewel of a temple, often overlooked as it is figuratively (and quite literally) overshadowed by its neighbor, the Char Narayan temple from the 16th century. A two-story structure, the monument is a classic Newar-style pagoda. It was erected in 1652 by Srinivasa Malla, a 17th century Malla king who ruled from 1661-85. It honors one of the king's brothers who predeceased him. The temple was not significantly damaged in the April 2015 earthquake.

The name Narayan (or Narayana) refers to an incarnation of Vishnu, and is represented in half-man, half-lion form. The image of the god himself is likely placed against the rear (west) wall of the small temple, but this is not possible to see as the interior is generally kept locked. In his pioneering work Temples of Nepal, Bernier writes that of the image of Narayan, "...It is said to be so terrifying that the display of its mask alone during dance performances on the platform near the temple is enough to make people die of fright." (Bernier, p. 64).

Above the square-shaped cella are an array of 12 struts that support the lower-level roof. Each strut is decorated with an image of Vishnu (similar to the form at the Char Narayan) with a depiction of his mount Garuda placed below. The upper level is purely ornamental and is inaccessible.

The monument is almost identical to the Lakshmi Narayan temple in Hanuman Dhoka square (Kathmandu), and is programatically similar to the 14th century Sulima temple, the oldest in Patan.

 'Octagonal_Chyasing_Deval':'''Chyasim Deval Krishna Temple (early 18th century, perhaps 1723) (Nepali: च्यासिम देवल कृष्ण मन्दिर)
Krishna Temple may have been built in 1723 by King Vishnu Malla (r. 1758-60), the 14th ruler of the Newar dynasty at Lalitpur (Yala). However, according to Michael Hutt, the temple was actually built by Yogamati, the daughter of King Yog Narendra (r. 1685-1705), Yogamati, who constructed it as a memorial to her son Lok Prakash, who died of smallpox at the age of eight. Like its counterpart to the north, the Krishna Mandir temple, it is built in the sikara style, imported from north India and Bengal. The word "Chyasim" or "Chyasing" means eight-sided, in reference to its octagonal plan.

The temple is the southernmost monument of the main group of temples on the west side of the Patan Darbar square, and is directly south of the Taleju Bell and west of the now-destroyed Bhai Deval, which did not survive the April 2015 earthquake. Unlike the latter monument, the Chyasim Deval survived largely intact.

 'Vishwanath_Temple':'''Vishwanath Temple (built 1627) (Nepali: विश्वनाथ मन्दिर)
Built in 1627 by King Narasimha of Lalitpur (r. 1620-61), this temple honors the god Shiva; its name refers to Shiva as "Lord of All" and is variously spelled "Vishwanath" or "Vishvanath". In keeping with the erotic imagery common to Shiva temples in India, the roof supports are decorated with erotic carvings. A stone linga is also enshrined inside the temple. Twin stone elephants guard the east entrance. According to Michael Hutt, a local legend holds that the king will not enter heaven until the stone elephants descend from the temple and drink from the Mani Dhara water fountain.

The temple was heavily damaged in a 6.5 magnitude earthquake in 1988 which resulted in the loss of the temple's original roof. Though it was quickly repaired, it was a foretaste of the constant menace that earthquakes posed to Patan's architectural heritage. Fortunately for the Vishvanath, it rode through the April 2015 earthquake largely intact, though it was temporarily retrofitted with bracing on several sides while minor repairs took place.
